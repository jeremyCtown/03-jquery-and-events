# JQuery and Events

**Author**: Peter Kim && Jeremy Crawford
**Version**: 1.0.3 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Focus of our efforts today was on populating the dropdown menus option using Author or Category filters. WE also wanted to use a single HTML file but give the feel of multiple HTML pages when navigating using the nav bar. Finally, we wanted to provide a preview of each blog article, and enable a click function to view the entire article.

## Getting Started
In order to build this app, you need to get the starter-code from Allie. Once you have that, you should work order your JS files so they are referenced after previous information (i.e. data then constructor then content styling). Finally, have lunch.

## Architecture
Languages used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery
All images rendered from Brook's personal collection.
